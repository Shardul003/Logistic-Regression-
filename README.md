Applying Logistic Regression on wine.csv
Logistic regression is a statistical model used for binary classification tasks, where the outcome variable is categorical and has two possible values (usually represented as 0 and 1).
<h1>Dataset Overview</h1>
<p>The wine.csv dataset typically contains information about various attributes of wines, such as alcohol content, acidity levels, etc.
It might also include a target variable indicating the quality of wine (e.g., good quality represented by 1, poor quality represented by 0).</p>
<h1>Training and Evaluation</h1>
<p>Training: The logistic regression model is trained using labeled data (where the wine quality is known for each instance in wine.csv).
Evaluation: Once trained, the model can predict the probability of wine quality for new, unseen instances. Typically, a threshold (e.g., 0.5) is used to classify instances into one of the classes (good or poor quality).</p>
